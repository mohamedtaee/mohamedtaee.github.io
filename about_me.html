                <strong>Who am I?</strong><br>
                My full name is
                <mark>Mohamed Hazem Mohamed</mark>
                . Yes, I know its weird name, I've heard of all the
                nicknames (Momo, Mohamed<sup>2</sup>, M&M, etc.). If you wanted to know, it is because of the naming
                system from
                where I was born (Baghdad, Iraq) sets a person's middle name as their father's name, and their last name
                as their grandfather's name. From that, you can conclude that my dad's name is Hazem and my grandpa's is
                Mohamed (who I'm named after).

                <strong>Iraq to USA</strong><br>
                You read it correct, I was born in Baghdad, Iraq. We escaped Iraq's regime to Syria as refugees, waiting
                nearly 2 years to be selected for a country that would accept us. We were luckily sent to the United
                States, specifically in Phoenix, Arizona.

                <strong>Before Programming</strong><br>
                I grew up fascinated with electronics and computers. I would disassemble broken appliances and broken
                computers. I had built several computers for myself and friends (using their finances obviously). I was
                taking on various tech challenges, setting up my own home enterprise network with several Linux servers
                running on old laptops. My parents, not seeing the connection of my interests, nudged me to the medical
                field. I got my B.S. in Molecular & Cellular Biology. I worked long hours in a research lab, scribing,
                and as a
                Arabic medical interpreter. Senior year of college, I took the MCAT twice, applied to medical school,
                interviewed, but no acceptance. Second time around, again no acceptance. I improved my resume and
                applied to Pharmacy school (a 4 year doctoral degree, but less focus on residency). I thought okay I
                lost 4 years of time, I will make it back up by pursuing a PharmD.
                <mark>Accepted, yay!</mark>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Taking a chance</strong><br>
                Following my acceptance, my wife and I had a long discussion and decided its best if I defer for a year
                and try the IT field. Building up to this, I was working in a reference laboratory (ARUP), but I was
                chasing projects dealing with IT/Computer Science. I had programmed a webpage that generated notes
                intended to clients based on certain criteria, and its all I wanted to do. I landed my first official
                job in IT as an IT Analyst. I was supporting a big department, fixing computer issues via hardware and
                software (writing scripts). This was it. This is where I wanted to be. Fast forward 3 years, and here I
                am solely writing code for multiple departments.
